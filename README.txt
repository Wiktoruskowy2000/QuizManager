This is the most simple code for a question and answer manager that I could write.
Using this code is very straightforward, but you must keep in mind that it does not remove empty answers. 
For example, if you declare that there should be 7 answers under a question, you must enter 7 answers. I will try to update this function in my next commit.

The code is unlicensed, so you can use it for commercial purposes.
